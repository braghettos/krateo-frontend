/**
 * Day-2 ops part B — the SCOPED, human-gated `patchField` mutating portal-action.
 *
 * GOVERNING INVARIANT (unchanged): Autopilot never mutates directly and never
 * reimplements behaviour — it drives the REAL portal by compiling a proposal into a
 * canonical `WidgetAction` and dispatching it through the SAME `useHandleAction`
 * dispatcher a Button/row-action uses. `patchField` is the FIRST mutating verb: it
 * lets the agent propose changing ONE spec field of the composition on THIS page as a
 * merge-patch, routed through the EXISTING W0-2 blast-radius gate (which renders the
 * diff and requires the human to confirm before anything runs).
 *
 * `patchField` is deliberately NOT a read-only registry verb (READONLY_VERB_REGISTRY is
 * read-only by construction). It is a DISTINCT mutating branch owned by the bridge, like
 * `runAction`. Two independent safety layers gate it:
 *   1. `isPatchAllowed(gvr, field)` (below) — a pure, defense-in-depth scoping kernel:
 *      ONLY a composition/instance kind (group ends with `composition.krateo.io`) and
 *      ONLY a single simple spec field (a bare key, or a `spec.`-prefixed dotted path).
 *      Anything else (a non-composition GVR, metadata/status/deletion paths, '*', empty)
 *      is REJECTED here — the branch returns null, exactly like an unknown verb.
 *   2. The W0-2 gate — the built PATCH is dispatched as a `rest` WidgetAction whose ref
 *      carries verb 'PATCH', so `runRest`'s `isMutatingVerb` chokepoint ALWAYS renders
 *      the BlastRadiusConfirm diff and blocks on the human's confirm. This module NEVER
 *      bypasses that gate; the scoping kernel is purely additive on top of it.
